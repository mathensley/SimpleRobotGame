# SimpleRobotGame
A simple Python (version 3.x) robot game to practice shortest path algorithms in grids. Currently, it's first version supports a single-player mode where either the player controls the robot or the AI uses the A* algorithm to find the best path. Future updates may include additional algorithms for enhanced gameplay.

## Game Description

- **Grid Map**: The game map is an NxM grid, represented as a matrix.
- **Objective**: The main objective is to collect all the treasures scattered across the grid.
- **Scoring**: The game includes a scoring system based on the treasures collected.

## Single-Player Mode

In single-player mode, you can either:
- Manually control the robot to navigate through the grid.
- Let the AI take over, using the A* algorithm to find the shortest path to the nearest treasure.

## How to Play

To start the game, run the following commands in your terminal:

1. Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd SimpleRobotGame
```
2. Run the game:
```sh
python main.py
```
